                    <p class="page_section_text">I have been playing piano since I learned how to read, the same as all of my five brothers and sisters. Growing up listening to my siblings play, I could not have been more excited to start learning.  When I started college, I decided to choose piano performance as my major of study. While I did not end up with a degree in performance, playing piano remains very important to me to this day. Here you can learn more and see some samples of my playing and writing.</p>

                    <p class="page_section_text">My alma mater, The Catholic University of America, had two a capella singing groups while I attended: Redline, and Take Note. I got recruited into Take Note by a friend my freshman year, and it was a wonderful experience to be part of that family. My senior year, I had the privilege of being elected the music director. I learned so much about what it takes to lead a group towards a common goal. Overall, my time with Take Note was invaluable.</p>

I have done a fair bit of woodworking because of my dad, and my favorite projects have certainly been the two instruments we built. The first was a three octave marimba for a Science Olympiad project, and the second is a full sized hammered dulcimer, just for fun. Learn more about the process for each, and hear a couple samples!</p>
