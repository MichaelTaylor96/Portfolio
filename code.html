What a journey I had working on this app. I was on a team of four, lead by my older brother, and we all had such fun (when we were not completely stressed out). The website is a massively multiplayer online pictionary game (MMOPG for short). We had to learn a completely new technology (WebSockets and Django Channels) in order to handle real time multiplayer modes. In the end, I think we made something that pretty fun to play, and certainly learned more than I could have guessed.</p>

It was alot of fun learning how to handle asynchronous functions, and certainly stretched my budding JavaScript skills to their max.</p>

It is a command line game of word guessing, modeled after the popular kid's game "Hangman" (now more appropriately named). The extra credit on this assignment was to create a computer that will change what word it is thinking of to dodge the player's guesses. My brother and I battled it out to see who could get the best algorithm. I like to believe I came out on top...</p>

                    <p class="page_section_text">The major new learning point in this project was how to use Python to read in data from a plain text file. In this case, we were using topographical data to construct an image of a topographical map using the Pillow library. We then had to algorithmically find the path through the map that required the least climbing up and down. I was not satisfied with a mere greedy algorithm and tried my best to find the TRUE best path, with great success and more than little head scratching.</p>

This assignment from Momentum was our first deep dive into Python, and tasked us with creating a command line version of the game. I had fun with it by allowing the player to set how many computers he or she would compete against, and by writing several strategy algorithms that the computers would be randomly assigned.</p>
